SEC. 602. IMPROVING ACCESS TO INFLUENTIAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIAL’S VISITOR ACCESS RECORDS.
(a) Disclosure Of White House Visitor Access Records.—Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and monthly thereafter, the President shall disclose to the public all White House visitor access records for the previous month that are redacted in accordance with subsection (c).

(b) Disclosure Of Agency Visitor Access Records.—Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and monthly thereafter, the head of each agency shall disclose to the public all visitor access records for the previous month for such agency head that are redacted in accordance with subsection (c).

(c) Information Not Disclosed.—The President under subsection (a), and the head of the relevant agency under subsection (b), as the case may be, may determine to not disclose the following information pursuant to this section:

(1) Any information—

(A) that implicates personal privacy or law enforcement concerns (such as date of birth, social security number, and contact phone number);

(B) that implicates the personal safety of White House staff (including daily arrival and departure); or

(C) whose release would so threaten national security interests that it outweighs a strong presumption in favor of the public’s interest in disclosure.

(2) For a non-renewable period of up to a year, any information related to purely personal guests of the first and second families, but only if the executive branch’s interest in protecting an unfettered consultation conducted in secret strongly outweighs the public’s interest in an accountable Government free of corruption and political influence.

(3) Any information related to a small group of particularly sensitive meetings (such as visits of potential Supreme Court nominees).
