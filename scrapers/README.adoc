# FlatGov Scrapers

Scrapers here are built using `scrapy` a Python web scraping framework. See https://docs.scrapy.org.

## Statements of Administration Policy

NOTE: I downloaded the entire whitehouse.gov site using:
`wget -r "https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/statements-of-administration-policy"`
(For just pdfs, we could have used:
`wget -r -A "*.pdf" "https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/statements-of-administration-policy"`)

This scraper is defined in `scrapers/statementAdminPolicy`. It downloads pdf files from `https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/statements-of-administration-policy` into the `scrapers/statementAdminPolicy/statementAdminPolicy/pdf` directory along with a metadata file with the link text, url and path information in `scrapers/statementAdminPolicy/statementAdminPolicy/pdf/meta.json`.

To run it:

```bash
$ cd ./scrapers/statementAdminPolicy
$ scrapy crawl sap_download > sap_download.log
```
