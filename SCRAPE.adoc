### Scraping bill text and metadata

This is only necessary if you want the text files (e.g. .txt, .html, .pdf) in the `congress` directory. It is more complicated and adds ~10Gb of data above the downloads from ProPublica which are automated in `flatgovtools/download_bills.sh`.

#### Install `unitedstates/congress` repository

The text of bills can be scraped with the Python project here: `https://github.com/unitedstates/congress`. First, clone this repository as a child of the `FlatGovDir` directory above, and a sibling of `congress`. In this way, running the scraper will fill out the text data within the `congress` directory.

```
$ cd /path/to/FlatGovDir
$ git clone https://github.com/unitedstates/congress.git
(no credentials needed-- it is an open repo)
```

#### Install scraper dependencies

Install the `congress` Python virtual environment, install the requirements (`pip install requirements.txt`). The scrapers were built with Python 2.7 and have not been upgraded; updates may be needed for a production environment, but the `@unitedstates/congress` scraper is sufficient to gather the baseline data to test the utilities in this repository.

NOTE: Scraping the initial data can be *very* time-consuming (most of a day, depending on your internet download speeds). To get started, it is worth finding a source for bulk downloads of the text, if possible.

On MacOS (Catalina), installing the `congress` requirements involved a few adjustments:

1. Install OpenSSL 1.02 with Homebrew. The latest OpenSSL (>1.1) causes problems with certain requirements; unfortunately, version 1.0.0 also failed. A script was set up by a Github user to install version 1.0.2.

`brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies; brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies; brew uninstall libressl --ignore-dependencies; brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/8b9d6d688f483a0f33fcfc93d433de501b9c3513/Formula/openssl.rb;`

2. Link the OpenSSL libraries

```
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

3. Install `pytz`, `pep517` and `cryptography` directly

```bash
pip install pytz
pip install pep517
pip install cryptography
```

4. Install requirements

From the `congress` repository directory, `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the scraper

```bash
./run govinfo --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS
./run bills
```

When running initially, I got an error because the bulk directories had not been made. To unzip the files manually in all directories:

`find . -name "*.zip" | xargs -P 5 -I fileName sh -c 'unzip -o -d "$(dirname "fileName")/$(basename -s .zip "fileName")" "fileName"'`


#### Download bill text and metadata with Django command using uscongress open source scraper.

1. Set up database

Before downloading bill text and metadata with Django command, make sure that postgresql database is ready set up.

Please see django_database.adoc about it.

2. Activate virtual environment and check if modules are imported.

If modules error, make sure
(1) you are in the python virtual environment
(2) environment variables are set
(3) requirements.txt has been run (if haven't yet)

```
cd /path/to/FlatGov/server_py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download bill text and metadata

- Run the django command `python manage.py update_bill`

It will download bills (113 ~ 116) using uscongress open source scraper and store them into `server_py/flatgov/congress/data`.

This process would take several hours.

We set up logging system, so we can keep tracking of the download status via console.

#### Update bill data in the database and loading of the `updated` bills into Elasticsearch

1. Create billsMeta.json file via Django command.

```bash
$ python manage.py bill_data
```

2. Process bills metadata

```bash
$ python manage.py process_bill_meta
```

3. Create related bills

```bash
$ python manage.py related_bills
```

4. Update loading of the `new` bills into Elasticsearch

```bash
$ python manage.py elastic_load --uscongress
```

Please note that we are using 2 data structures - one is flat structure, the other one is open source structure.

If you are going to use open source structure, add option `--uscongress` to the django command above.

`getXMLDirByCongress` function address the bill path based on the data structure.

If you are going to use flat structure, run django command without option `python manage.py elastic_load`


5. Add similarity to the bill

```bash
$ python manage.py bill_similarity --uscongress
```

Please note that we are using 2 data structures - one is flat structure, the other one is open source structure.

If you are going to use open source structure, add option `--uscongress` to the django command above.

`getXMLDirByCongress` function address the bill path based on the data structure.

If you are going to use flat structure, run django command without option `python manage.py bill_similarity`
