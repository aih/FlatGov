### Scraping bill text and metadata

This is only necessary if you want the text files (e.g. .txt, .html, .pdf) in the `congress` directory. It is more complicated and adds ~10Gb of data above the downloads from ProPublica which are automated in `scripts/download_bills.sh`.

#### Install `unitedstates/congress` repository

The text of bills can be scraped with the Python project here: `https://github.com/unitedstates/congress`. First, clone this repository as a child of the `FlatGovDir` directory above, and a sibling of `congress`. In this way, running the scraper will fill out the text data within the `congress` directory.

```
$ cd /path/to/FlatGovDir
$ git clone https://github.com/unitedstates/congress.git
(no credentials needed-- it is an open repo)
```

#### Install scraper dependencies

Install the `congress` Python virtual environment, install the requirements (`pip install requirements.txt`). The scrapers were built with Python 2.7 and have not been upgraded; updates may be needed for a production environment, but the `@unitedstates/congress` scraper is sufficient to gather the baseline data to test the utilities in this repository.

NOTE: Scraping the initial data can be *very* time-consuming (most of a day, depending on your internet download speeds). To get started, it is worth finding a source for bulk downloads of the text, if possible.

On MacOS (Catalina), installing the `congress` requirements involved a few adjustments:

1. Install OpenSSL 1.02 with Homebrew. The latest OpenSSL (>1.1) causes problems with certain requirements; unfortunately, version 1.0.0 also failed. A script was set up by a Github user to install version 1.0.2.

`brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies; brew uninstall openssl --ignore-dependencies; brew uninstall libressl --ignore-dependencies; brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/8b9d6d688f483a0f33fcfc93d433de501b9c3513/Formula/openssl.rb;`

2. Link the OpenSSL libraries

```
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

3. Install `pytz`, `pep517` and `cryptography` directly

```bash
pip install pytz
pip install pep517
pip install cryptography
```

4. Install requirements

From the `congress` repository directory, `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the scraper

```bash
./run govinfo --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS
./run bills
```

When running initially, I got an error because the bulk directories had not been made. To unzip the files manually in all directories:

`find . -name "*.zip" | xargs -P 5 -I fileName sh -c 'unzip -o -d "$(dirname "fileName")/$(basename -s .zip "fileName")" "fileName"'`
