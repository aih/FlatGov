### Scraping CRS Reports and Associate with Bills

To run these scripts:

1. Copy `billsMeta.json` to the root of the project.
 2. Rename database.ini.template to database.ini and set the config of your local postgres DB.
 3. Run the following scripts:
        - `python bulk_download.py` (to download report metadata json and pdf files) It should take a long time.
        - `python create_table.py` (to create bills and crs table in crs database)
        - `python insert_mock_billdata.py` (to insert bill numbers from billsMeta.json to bills table)
        - `python main.py` (This is the main script to read the `report.csv` and associate reports with bill numbers)
