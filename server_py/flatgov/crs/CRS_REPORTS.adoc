## About

This is the Django based scraper for the CRS reports.

## Installation

```shell
pyenv activate flatgov # Assumes Python >=3.7
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Collecting the data

Two models are involved: `Bills` and `CrsReport`. The table `Bills` assumed to exist and have a bills data.

To scrape the data to CRS table enter a Django console and do:

```shell
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from crs.populate_crs_table import CrsFromApi
crs_api = CrsFromApi()
crs_api.populate()
```

Then, when running the application, to download a CSV report of the data, go to `/crs/csv-report/`. This may take a long time, and can be a large file to download from a remote server.
